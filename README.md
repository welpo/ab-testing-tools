A landing page for my free (as in freedom) experimentation tools.

## Featured tools

- **[A/B Test Sample Size & Duration Calculator](https://calculator.osc.garden)**: Plan experiment duration and sample size based on traffic, conversion rates, and target improvements.
- **[Sample Ratio Mismatch Calculator](https://srm.osc.garden)**: Check if A/B test traffic was correctly distributed to detect sample ratio mismatch (SRM) that could invalidate results.
- **[Stop Early Stopping](https://stop-early-stopping.osc.garden)**: Visualise why peeking at significance levels during experiments drastically increases false positive rates.
